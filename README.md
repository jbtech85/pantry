# Pantry - let nothing go to waste
The goal of this app is to use all the food in your cupboards before it goes bad.  Less food wasted, more money saved.


I'm using this as a space to practice.  Mind the mess and poor styling; the priority here is reinforcing various skills.
I enjoy working alongside tutorials in a separate environment, but am taking the opportunity to also put the pieces together here.
